This folder contains the MATLAB code developed to determine the static properties of systems of superconducting qubits using Quantum Circuit Analysis.
The code consists of two main MATLAB classes, FluxQubit.m, used to symulate single circuits and QubitsInteract.m used to study magnetically an capacitively interacting systems.
Exaple files explaining how to use these classes are included.

Version v1 is working and tested on MATLAB 2018b.
Version v2 is currently under development and still incomplete.
